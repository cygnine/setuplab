                            1.) About
________________________________________________________________________________

This is a collection of tools meant to shoehorn the way Matlab works into a more
Python-ic behavior. Setuplab provides the ability to write code like:

>> import speclab                     % imports the package speclab
                                      % variable 'speclab' is created

>> from speclab.orthopoly1d import jacobi    % imports the sub-package jacobi
                                             % variable 'jacobi' is created

>> import speclab.orthopoly1d as opoly % imports orthopoly1d into variable opoly

>> from speclab.orthopoly1d.jacobi.quad import gauss_quadrature as gq
                                    % imports gauss_quadrature into variable gq

>> from speclab.orthopoly1d.jacobi.quad import *  % imports ALL functions from the
                                                  % specified submodule.

The "import" and "from" functions do nasty things using "assignin" statements,
which will cause errors if Matlab's optimizer flags one of your functions as a
static workspace and then you try to dynamically create variables using "import"
and "from".

The "from_as" and "imp_as" functions, which are output-driven functional forms
of "from" and "import" are nicely-behaved functions, using no "assignin"
messiness.

The objects that are imported to the specified variables depend on how your
init__.m files are written (see the setup+installation section).

                            2.) Setup + Install
________________________________________________________________________________

The file setup.m is the only "installation" required. Just cd into the setuplab
directory and run 

>> setup;

from the Matlab command prompt. You can then cd out of the directory and work as
normal. 

Setuplab does two things:
- crawls through parallel directories ("packages") and searches for "init__.m"
  files in those directories. If it does not find one, the directory is ignored.
  If it does find such a file, it runs the file and stores the output in the
  field of a struct with fieldname equal to the directory name.
- adds the setuplab/global directory to the global Matlab path. This makes some
  Pythonic from/import-like statements available.

If a package "labtools" is found, it is parsed first because the contents of
that package may be used by other packages.

For an example of an init__.m file, look at labtools, shapelab, or speclab.


Consider the following scenario:
1.) You boot up Matlab
2.) You run 'setup' as directed above
3.) You make some changes to one of your Pythonic packages or to setuplab.
4.) You attempt to use the setuplab handles to access the newly defined
    functions.

You will notice that when attempting #4, the old definitions (before you made
new changes) will be the only versions of the function Matlab sees. The reason
for this is that when Matlab creates an anonymous function (which is how
setuplab works), it takes a snapshot of the function *when you create the
handle*. If something is updated after the handle is created, Matlab doesn't
check for this. To force Matlab to revamp all the handles, you'll have to cd
back into the setuplab directory and run 'setup'.

To ease this process, there is a globally-defined function (added to the PATH)
called 'resetup'. This reruns setup. WARNING: resetup destroys all workspace
data; if you want to save something, you should save variables to disk before
resetup-ing.

                            3.) Intended audience
________________________________________________________________________________

This module is for use primarily in tandem with another Pythonic Matlab package,
e.g. Speclab. It is not really meant to be stand-alone, unless you want to use
it for your own development.

                            4.) Development history
________________________________________________________________________________

If you'd like the whole development history for this collection, you'll need the
open-source "distributed version control system" called "git". 

You can clone the repo with the command:
git clone git://github.com/cygnine/setuplab.git

You may navigate a web browser to http://www.github.com/cygnine/setuplab and
github will show a pretty GUI of the development history and included files.
You can also download a tarball directly from github of each repo, but the
tarball won't have the history.
